#!/bin/bash 

# TEMPLATE for environment variables / API tokens used by your shell.
#
# USAGE:
# 1. Copy this file to `tokens.sh`.
# 2. Replace placeholder values with your actual tokens.
# 3. Keep `tokens.sh` out of version control (see .gitignore).
#
# ALTERNATIVES:
# You can switch this out for a secrets manager e.g. macOS Keychain
# or even better 'pass' (will work on across most operating systems)
# I've left it agnostic. The option is up to you...investigate and decide which you prefer.
